# AI Prompt Optimizer

This project is a web application designed to help users optimize their AI prompts. It leverages various prompt engineering techniques to enhance clarity, efficiency, and effectiveness of prompts for different AI models and platforms.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Prompt Analysis:** Understands prompt intent, complexity, and domain.
- **Platform & Model Selection:** Supports various AI platforms (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude) and models.
- **Domain Specialization:** Tailor prompts for specific domains like technology, creative writing, or business.
- **Provider Flexibility:** Choose between different API providers (e.g., Groq).
- **Secure API Key Management:** Store and use your API keys securely.
- **Advanced Optimization Techniques:** Apply a suite of techniques including:
    - Chain of Thought
    - Few-Shot Learning
    - ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)
    - Persona Injection
    - Role-Playing Scenarios
    - Constraint Integration
    - Token Optimization
    - Tree of Thoughts
    - Self-Consistency
- **Optimization Results:** View the original prompt alongside the optimized version.
- **Performance Metrics:** Includes token count comparison (original vs. optimized) and an estimated improvement score.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive experience.

## How It Works

This application streamlines the AI prompt optimization process through the following workflow:

1.  **Input:** The user provides their initial prompt, selects the target AI platform, relevant domain, and preferred API provider. API keys can also be managed within the app.
2.  **Analysis & Configuration:** The system analyzes the input prompt for intent, complexity, and domain. The user can then configure advanced optimization options based on this analysis or their preferences.
3.  **Optimization:** Core logic in `src/utils/promptEngineering.ts` and `src/utils/promptOptimizer.ts` applies selected techniques (like Chain of Thought, Persona Injection, etc.) to the prompt.
4.  **Results:** The application displays the original prompt alongside the newly optimized version, including a comparison of token counts and an estimated improvement score.

This process helps in crafting more effective and efficient prompts tailored to specific needs.

## Screenshots

*(Coming Soon: Add screenshots of the application in action here. For example, the main interface, prompt input, optimization options, and results display.)*
